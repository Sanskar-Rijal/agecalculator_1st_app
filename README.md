# agecalculator_1st_app
After the end of second semister exams i started learning kotlin and this was the first app i made using kotlin.
In this application i used a function called date picker dialogue which was already made by some one in java.It uses linear layout instead of constrain layout.
XML was used to design the application and the text view,button etc were called to MainActivity.kt using their "id"
findviewbyid(R.id.id_of_textview or button..)
only one button is used i.e to enter the date of birth of the person 
when the user clicks the button the setOnClicklistner calls the date picker dialogue function and display the calander and asks for date.
Basically that's it i learned about the function date picker dialogue and setonclick listner method.
